# Life Expectancy Analysis: Population and Alcohol Consumption Study

## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between population size and two key health indicators:

1. **Alcohol consumption patterns**
2. **Life expectancy rates**

Using Python data analysis tools, we explore whether larger populations are linked to higher or lower alcohol consumption levels and examine how population size impacts overall life expectancy across different countries.

## Dataset

- **Source**: WHO Life Expectancy Data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
- **Key Variables Used**: 
  - Population size
  - Alcohol consumption per capita
  - Life expectancy (years)
- **Coverage**: Global data across multiple countries and years

## Methodology

### Data Processing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers using Pandas
- **Data Preparation**: Standardized units and normalized population data
- **Quality Checks**: Validated data consistency across variables

### Analysis Techniques
- **Correlation Analysis**: Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between variables
- **Statistical Testing**: Performed significance tests for relationships
- **Visualization**: Created comprehensive charts using Matplotlib
